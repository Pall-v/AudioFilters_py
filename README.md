### Overview


### Functions

###### change_speed
This function changes the audio speed, speeding up or down an audio signal.

###### add_reverb
This function applies an effect to an audio signal so that it sounds like it was recorded in a different environment.

###### high_pass_filter
This function uses convolution to attenuate a 1-D (audio) signal signal for frequencies above a specified cutoff level.

### Python Ecosystem

Python software packages that have the same/similar functionality:
- [Pyo](https://github.com/belangeo/pyo) is a Python module that Python module provides a variety of audio signal processing type, including reverb http://ajaxsoundstudio.com/pyodoc/examples/07-effects/02-schroeder-reverb.html?highlight=reverb although it is a for a specific type of reverb which we do not plan to implement.
- 
- Seewave http://rug.mnhn.fr/seewave/ is an an R package dedicated to sound analysis and synthesis and includes a filter, ffilter http://rug.mnhn.fr/seewave/HTML/MAN/ffilter.html with similar functionality to our high-pass filter

a paragraph describing where your packages fit into the Python and R ecosystems (are there any other Python or R software packages that have the same/similar functionality? Provide links to any that do. if none exist, then clearly state this as well).
